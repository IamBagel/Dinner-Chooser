# Dinner-Chooser
A basic java application to choose what is for dinner. Currently under development. This is meant to be a practice for my Java programming, it will begin as an incredibly basic application (which it is now) and slowly grow over time.

If you have any comments let me know through using issues! I would love some feedback!
